# Repository Reorganization Summary

## What Changed

This repository was previously organized as a nested git structure:
```
Aikido/ (git repo)
├── .git/
├── Aikido.sln
├── docs/
└── aikidolive/ (nested git repo)
    ├── .git/
    ├── AikidoLive.csproj
    ├── AikidoLive.sln
    └── [application code]
```

## After Reorganization

The repository structure has been consolidated into a single git repository:
```
AikidoLibrary/ (single git repo)
├── .git/
├── Aikido.sln (updated paths)
├── AikidoLive.csproj
├── AikidoLive.sln
├── docs/ (merged documentation)
└── [application code]
```

## Benefits

1. **Simplified structure**: No more confusion about which repository to work in
2. **Single source of truth**: All code, documentation, and configuration in one place
3. **Easier collaboration**: Contributors only need to clone one repository
4. **Cleaner CI/CD**: Deployment processes can reference a single repository
5. **Better IDE support**: Visual Studio and VS Code work better with unified projects

## Git History

- The main application history from `aikidolive` repository is preserved
- Documentation and configuration from the root level has been merged
- All remote connections (GitHub origin and Azure deployment) are maintained

## Next Steps

- Update any CI/CD pipelines to reference the new repository structure
- Update local development environment paths if needed
- Consider updating the repository name to better reflect the unified structure

## Files Moved/Merged

- ✅ `Aikido.sln` - Moved and updated project paths
- ✅ `docs/` - Merged documentation from both levels
- ✅ All application code preserved in place
- ✅ Git history and remotes preserved
